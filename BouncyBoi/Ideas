Game is Called BouncyBoi
Will Be of game where little bouncy boy will need to dodge falling sharp objects
Since he is bouncy he can only move by bouncing to and from
Bouncy Boi Movement Physics:
  - Will bounce in an arc
  - Can only decide direction while on the ground
  - While in the air it is up to physics
Objects Falling:
  - Will start slowly
  - Mainly increase in number, then in speed
  
Suggestions:
  - Maybe make the boy more manuverable?
  - Make movement and dodging feel more gratifying
